## 🚀 Day 01 – 100 Days of Coding

Today I started my Python journey with the **Udemy – Complete Python Bootcamp by Angela Yu**.

I covered the basics and built a small beginner project: **Brand Name Generator**.

## 📚 What I Learned Today

- `print()` function
- Escape sequences
- String concatenation
- `input()` function
- Variables
- Created a mini project using these concepts

All concepts are from the **Udemy Python Course – Complete Python Bootcamp by Angela Yu**.

## 🧩 Project — Brand Name Generator

This simple Python program asks:

- the city I grew up in
- my pet’s name
    
    Then it combines them to create a fun brand name.

## 📌 Code

```python
print("Welcome to the Brand Name Generator.")

city = input("What's the name of the city you grew up in? ")
pet = input("What's your pet's name? ")

print("Your brand could be " + city + " " + pet)

```
### Output
```
What's the name of the city you grew up in? Mandya
what's your pet's name? Jimmy
Your brand could be Mandya Jimmy

```
