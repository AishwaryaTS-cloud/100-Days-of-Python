# 100-Days-of-Python
About I’m embarking on the [100 Days Of Code] style challenge: one small project each day for 100 days, using Python to learn, build and grow. This journey is based around the course “Master Python by building 100 projects in 100 days”, where I’ll explore automation, data-science, web apps, games, GUIs and more.
